## Why I list CS jobs for Undergraduate Institutions
- **If you would like to add a listing to this page (https://cs-pui.github.io/), [please click  here for instructions](guide.html)**

In 2017, I [wrote an article about finding academic happiness on the job market](https://medium.com/bucknell-hci/the-jobs-i-didnt-see-my-misconceptions-of-the-academic-job-market-9cb98b057422) and why I chose [Bucknell](http://www.eg.bucknell.edu/~emp017/). Since then, I continue to receive emails with the same follow-up question: _how do I find these jobs?_ This listing of schools for the 2020/21 hiring season in CS is meant to help navigate that muddy water. To see last year's list, [visit the Medium article](https://medium.com/@evanmpeck/cs-academic-job-market-for-liberal-arts-colleges-19-20-cd348423f919).

### My criteria for colleges/universities on this page
This document does not contain all (or even most) CS positions. Instead, it is designed for graduate students who want to invest in teaching/mentorship with undergrads while still staying active in their scholarship. My criteria:
- Tenure-track positions accessible to those with a Ph.D. in CS
- Universities that identify as **primarily-undergraduate colleges and universities**. 
- Institutions that highly value teaching, but also secure time and financial resources for faculty to remain engaged with research. This typically means a reduced teaching load (often 2/2 or 3/2) with professional support funds. 
  - _Note: scholarship varies **significantly** between the institutions on this list. If research is important to you, I would encourage all applicants to carefully read ads and ask questions related to teaching loads, scholarly expectations, and institutional support. In the past, I've been picky about this criteria, but to avoid acting as a biased filter (and because of the more challenging market), I'm allowing departments to make that judgment call for themselves this year_
  
### Resources for navigating the job market
While I don't expect to have a lengthy resources list here, there are a couple I want to highlight because they compile wisdom from many people (including those who have gone onto PUIs).
